    <h3>Background Introduction</h3>
    <p><strong>Could you please start by introducing yourself and your current work?</strong></p>
    <p>Hello everyone, my name is Jui-Chung Yang, and I am currently a professor in the Department of Economics. I mainly teach <span class="keyword" data-tooltip="A branch of economics that combines economic theory, mathematical models, and statistical methods to analyze real economic data, explore relationships among variables, test theories, and make forecasts or policy evaluations.">econometrics</span>, which involves analyzing real-world data to answer questions related to economics. In addition to that, I am especially interested in climate change issues—for instance, how climate change affects economic growth across countries, whether rising electricity prices in Taiwan can encourage people to reduce electricity usage to meet near-zero carbon goals, or how extreme weather events such as the increasing frequency of wildfires impact human life.</p>

    <p><strong>How is your work related to sustainable development? Could you give some concrete examples?</strong></p>
    <p>My research directly involves the relationship between climate change and economic growth. For example, one of my studies examines how much global GDP might decline if climate change continues to worsen. I also focus on how energy pricing policies influence carbon reduction behavior—these topics are closely tied to sustainable development.</p>

    <p><strong>If you had to describe your work using three keywords, which would you choose and why?</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Econometrics</strong>: Because my research methods are primarily rooted in this field.</li>
      <li><strong>Climate Change</strong>: Because it is the core theme of my research.</li>
      <li><strong>Education</strong>: Because as a teacher, teaching and interacting with students are essential parts of my job.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="post-section">
    <h3>Career Path</h3>
    <p><strong>Could you share your career path from graduation to now?</strong></p>
    <p>I received my PhD from Texas A&M University in 2014, and then worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Southern California, mainly focusing on econometrics. During that period, I began exploring climate change and its economic impacts. After finishing my postdoctoral work, I returned to Taiwan and taught as an assistant professor in the Department of Economics at National Tsing Hua University for four years. In 2021, I returned to my alma mater, National Taiwan University, where I currently teach.</p>

    <p><strong>What inspired you to get involved in sustainability-related work?</strong></p>
    <p>During my postdoctoral research, our team came across a paper that suggested climate change could significantly reduce GDP. We were skeptical of the results and began a study to produce more precise estimates. In the process, I gradually came to understand the deep impact of climate change on human society, which motivated me to stay involved in this area of research.</p>

    <p><strong>How did your initial expectations compare with the reality of your work?</strong></p>
    <p>Before I started working on climate change, I wasn't very familiar with the topic. In fact, many people around me didn't think it was a serious issue. But after entering the field, I encountered two extreme viewpoints: some people completely denied the impact of climate change, while others believed in taking extreme measures to combat it. This made me start thinking about how to find a balance between idealism and practicality, and how to propose carbon reduction policies that society could accept.</p>

    <p><strong>What has been your biggest challenge in the workplace, and how did you overcome it?</strong></p>
    <p>The academic world is highly stressful. Young researchers are expected to publish high-quality papers, which creates a lot of mental pressure. I know many scholars who have even needed to seek help from mental health professionals. Personally, I manage stress through exercise—running, for example, is an effective way for me to stay physically and mentally healthy.</p>

  <div class="post-section">
    <h3>Daily Work Life</h3>
    <p><strong>Could you describe what a typical day looks like for you? What kind of work do you do from morning to evening?</strong></p>
    <p>My job involves teaching, research, and mentoring students. I spend time preparing lectures, discussing research progress with students, and writing or revising academic papers. I also attend conferences to exchange ideas and findings with other scholars.</p>

    <p><strong>If you were to rate your work-life balance on a scale from 1 to 10, what score would you give and why?</strong></p>
    <p>I would give it a 5. Academic research requires a great deal of time, which leads to significant work-related stress and affects life balance. However, I maintain my mental and physical health through exercise—I really enjoy running marathons, and I also serve as the advisor for NTU’s marathon club. Through this hobby, I've been lucky to find some degree of balance between work and life.</p>

    <p><strong>Who do you work or collaborate with the most? Are there any memorable aspects of those interactions?</strong></p>
    <p>I frequently collaborate with other economists, environmental scientists, and students. I've noticed that researchers from different backgrounds have diverse perspectives on climate change. For instance, environmental engineers may focus more on technical aspects, while economists tend to think about how to design effective policies in response to climate issues.</p>

    <h3>Advice for Young People</h3>
    <p><strong>What kind of person do you think is well-suited for this job (becoming a scholar)? What professional skills are required?</strong></p>
    <p>This job suits people who are curious, analytical, and patient. Econometrics requires a strong foundation in mathematics and statistics, along with the patience to analyze data carefully and extract meaningful insights.</p>

    <p><strong>In your view, what are the future trends in this field?</strong></p>
    <p>The impacts of climate change will receive more and more attention in the future. Fields like policymaking and economic planning will need experts who understand both data analysis and the economics of climate change. Key research directions include carbon pricing, climate finance, and the economic evaluation of carbon reduction technologies.</p>

    <p><strong>Finally, do you have any specific advice or encouragement for young people who want to enter this field?</strong></p>
    <blockquote>I suggest that young people interested in this field begin by developing strong data analysis skills and following global discussions on climate change and economic policy. Also, keep an open mind and be willing to understand perspectives from different disciplines. That’s the key to finding more effective solutions. Most importantly, have passion and perseverance—climate change research is a long journey, but its social impact is far-reaching and definitely worth the effort.</blockquote>

    <p>In addition to that advice, I’d like to emphasize that climate change research is an interdisciplinary field. It requires not only economics, but also knowledge from the natural and social sciences. So, besides professional training, I also encourage developing cross-disciplinary collaboration skills. Working with experts from different backgrounds is essential to making more comprehensive contributions to this complex issue.</p>
