        <h3>Background & Vision</h3>

        <p><strong>Can you briefly introduce yourself and your current role?</strong></p>
        <p>Ricky graduated from Stanford University with a major in Comparative Literature and later pursued a graduate certificate in Sustainability Science and Practice. This academic foundation paved the way for his climate career. After graduation, he joined Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC), promoting electric vehicle (EV) policies. He then transitioned to the energy sector, working on geothermal projects and witnessing firsthand the transformative impact of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) on the green industry. Returning to Taiwan in late 2024, he became co-CEO of the Taiwan Youth Climate Coalition and co-founded the Climate Era Catalyst (CEC). His work now centers on policy advocacy, international collaboration, and building bridges with governmental institutions and legislative bodies.</p>

        <p><strong>How does your work relate to sustainable development?</strong></p>
        <p>Ricky has long been committed to the practical and systemic dimensions of sustainability. During his time in the U.S., he helped extend California’s 2035 EV mandate to other states and promoted the application of the IRA to enable sustainable transformation while reducing operational costs for businesses. Upon returning to Taiwan, he is now working to design a climate bill rooted in social justice, adapting U.S. policy frameworks to fit local contexts</p>

        <p><strong>If you had to choose three keywords to describe your work, what would they be—and why?</strong></p>
        <p>Ricky’s three words are: dynamic, multifaceted, and resilient.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Dynamic</strong>, because he must constantly stay attuned to global political, social, and technological developments.</li>
            <li><strong>Multifaceted</strong>, because his work spans policy, communication, modeling, stakeholder engagement, and beyond.</li>
            <li><strong>Resilience</strong>, because pushing for climate reform requires immense mental strength and long-term commitment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Career Path</h3>

        <p><strong>Could you share your career journey from graduation to now?</strong></p>
        <p>Even as a student, Ricky was curious about diverse fields—majoring in literature, experimenting with online virtual tours, and interning in media. He describes himself as someone “always exploring.” A pivotal moment came during an exchange program in the UK and after reading No Impact Man, which deeply influenced his resolve to pursue climate work. Although he initially lacked a technical background, he gradually found his footing through interdisciplinary coursework, internships, and hands-on work in policy and energy. His path led him from EV advocacy to geothermal business development, gaining experience across sectors and continents.</p>

        <p><strong>How did your expectations of this field compare with reality?</strong></p>
        <p>He admits he initially had an idealistic view of sustainability—assuming that reducing emissions for businesses would be a clear win-win. However, he soon encountered the “rebound effect,” where improved efficiency increased product sales and overall emissions. He also saw how companies often use sustainability for marketing rather than meaningful change. This led him to rethink how to enable real transformation within the system, exploring strategies like “symbiotic disruption” and “change from within.”</p>
    
        <p><strong>What has been your biggest challenge at work—and how did you overcome it?</strong></p>
        <p>The biggest obstacle isn’t technology or funding, but social psychology and political negotiations. Ricky explains that Taiwan, like many countries, has sufficient technologies but lacks the political communication tools and collective readiness for action. To cope with that, he reframed his climate anxiety into a resolve to act with “pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will.” He draws inspiration from the book Humankind, realizing that people are not indifferent—they’re just overwhelmed by societal pressures.</p>

        <p><strong>What advice would you give your 20-year-old self?</strong></p>
        <blockquote>“I’d tell myself: showing up and reaching out never hurts.”</blockquote>
        <p>He used to be introverted, but learned that by simply attending events, writing emails, and asking questions, unexpected opportunities would arise. In fact, his collaboration with a former U.S. climate advisor started with a single email. “The world isn’t as closed-minded as you think. All you need is to take the first step.”</p>

        <h3>Daily Life & Work</h3>

        <p><strong>What does a typical workday look like for you?</strong></p>
        <p>His schedule is fast-paced and highly flexible, often traveling between Taipei and Taichung. Each day is different—he might meet with government officials in the morning, give a university lecture in the afternoon, or engage with lawmakers. He describes it as “a new day every day,” with no fixed hours, as his tasks dictate the rhythm.</p>

        <p><strong>On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your work-life balance?</strong></p>
        <p>A solid 10.</p>
        <p>Although his hours are irregular, he appreciates the autonomy and alignment with his personal mission. With this freedom, he still finds time for dancing, learning languages, and other interests. “I honestly can’t imagine a more fulfilling lifestyle than this.”</p>

        <p><strong>Who are your most frequent collaborators, and what stands out about working with them?</strong></p>
        <p>He regularly works with legislators, government agencies, businesses, local communities, and the public. What stands out most is that “people actually want to help.” When others resonate with the mission, they’re eager to share resources and networks. The key, he says, is helping stakeholders see that “we have more in common than we think.”</p>

        <h3>Advice for the Next Generation</h3>

        <p><strong>What trends do you foresee in this field?</strong></p>
        <p>He believes climate work will become increasingly “declimatized.” Many future climate workers—like electricians, cold-chain technicians, or grid engineers—may not even see themselves as part of the climate movement, yet they’ll be at its core. This shift will turn climate action into everyday labor.</p>

        <p><strong>What qualities or skills are needed for this career path?</strong></p>
        <p>“There’s no one ideal personality or background,” he says. Coming from a humanities background, he’s integrated climate themes into dance, writing, and policy. “Climate is everyone’s issue,” and anyone willing to contribute can find a meaningful role.</p>

        <p><strong>What’s your final advice for young people interested in this field?</strong></p>
        <p>He offers three key messages:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Showing up is the beginning of opportunity</strong>：Just being present and vocal opens surprising doors.</li>
            <li><strong>Altruism is also self-benefit</strong>：Helping others builds trust, relationships, and a deeper sense of value.</li>
            <li><strong>Passion is about finding yourself</strong>：mission is about losing yourself in something bigger than you: Real change comes not just from excitement, but from a long-term commitment and collective effort.</li>
        </ul>
